A masked man appeared in the distance. Orange, swirly, one holed mask. The masked man introduced himself as Uchiha Madara. A legendary shinobi in the Naruto world. One day, Naruto and Sasuke found Madara, and then the battle started. Madara started running toward Naruto and tried to kicked him, but, fortunately, Sasuke saw first, so he punched Madara back.
It turns out that it was all an illusion however, and Madara transformed into a potato once he was hit. At this point Naruto felt hungry and decided to try to eat the potato. He regretted it right away.
