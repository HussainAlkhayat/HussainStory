A masked man appeared in the distance. Orange, swirly, one holed mask. The masked man introduced himself as Uchiha Madara. A legendary shinobi in the Naruto world. One day, Naruto and Sasuke found Madara, and then the battle started. Madara started running toward Naruto and tried to kicked him, but, fortunately, Sasuke saw first, so he punched Madara back.
It turns out that it was all an illusion however, and Madara transformed into a potato once he was hit. At this point Naruto felt hungry and decided to try to eat the potato. He regretted it right away.
The potato tasted horrible and Naruto almost gagged, but he realized this opportunity to prank Sasuke. He pretended the potato was delicious and encouraged Sasuke to try a piece.
After Sasuke felt the horrible potato youches his tongue, he immediatly used his sharingan on naruto to punish him of this prank. Naruto cleverly released the chakra to get out of th esharingan. Then both Naruto and Sasuke fought Madara and defeated him.
