A masked man appeared in the distance. Orange, swirly, one holed mask. The masked man introduced himself as Uchiha Madara. A legendary shinobi in the Naruto world. One day, Naruto and Sasuke found Madara, and then the battle started. Madara started running toward Naruto and tried to kicked him, but, fortunately, Sasuke saw first, so he punched Madara back.
